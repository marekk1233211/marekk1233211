<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, Iâ€™m Marek Korczak</h1>

#### My roadmap to becoming a programmer is as follows:

:thumbsup: I have acquired fundamental programming skills in C, C++, and C# during my schooling and university studies. <br>
:thumbsup: I have delved into fundamental programming skills in C++, JavaScript while working in the role of an automation engineer. <br>
:thumbsup: I have covered the basic frontend development skills including HTML, CSS, Sass, JavaScript, React, and Git through courses at Samuraj Programowania and kodilla. <br>
:thumbsup: I gained a foundation in backend development using Node.js and Express while working on my own project, EduBuddy. <br>
:thumbsup: Presently, I'm in the process of familiarizing myself with the fundamental concepts of programming in Java, Java OOP, MySQL, Cucumber, SeleniumWebDriver, Postman, SoapUI, and manual testing through a course at Coders Lab. <br> <br>

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in frontend development the most, but I am looking opportunities to develop applications also in the backend because it's so fun !
